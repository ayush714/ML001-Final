            <p>
              Machine learning will automate jobs that most people thought could
              only be done by people. In this course, you will learn from basics
              of machine learning to advanced level in machine learning, you
              will understand both theory + practical, you will work on building
              real world machine learning systems, and formulating the machine
              learning problem, we covered everything one needs to know about
              machine learning talking about theory as well as practicals.
              Students also given problem sets that contains both technical and
              theoretical questions. It takes a lot of time to develop all of
              this, it will be very helpful for me if you watch this course on
              Newera [ https://youtube.com/c/neweraa ] and subscribe the
              channel.
